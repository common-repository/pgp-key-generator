== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= PGP Key Generator is not available in my language. What can I do ? =
You can translate PGP Key Generator in your language, then submit your translation, so everybody would can use it.
To do it, we have [a project hosted at Transifex](https://www.transifex.net/projects/p/wp2pgpmail/) where you can add the translation in your language. It's simple, fast and effective. Or:

1. Download and install [Poedit](http://www.poedit.net/)
1. Open the PGP Key Generator POT file from **pgp-key-generator/i18n/pgp-key-generator.pot**
1. Go to **File => Save as...** to save your translations in a PO file (*pgp-key-generator-fr_FR.po* for example)
1. Once the translation done, go to **File => Save as...** again to generate the MO file
1. Send us the PO and MO files to translation@wp2pgpmail.com : we will add them to the next release of the plugin
